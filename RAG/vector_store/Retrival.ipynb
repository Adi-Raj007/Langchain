Based on the passage, choose the best \\nanswer for each question. \\nLanding in Australia, the British colonists weren\\'t much impressed with the small-bodied, \\nslender-snooted marsupials called bandicoots. \"Their muzzle, which is much too long, gives \\nthem an air exceedingly stupid,\" one naturalist noted in 1805. They nicknamed one type the \\n\"zebra rat\" because of its black-striped rump. \\nSilly-looking or not, though, the zebra rat-the smallest bandicoot, more commonly known today \\nas the western barred bandicoot-exhibited a genius for survival in the harsh outback, where its \\nancestors had persisted for some 26 million years. Its births were triggered by rainfall in the \\nbone-dry desert. It carried its breath-mint-size babies in a backward-facing pouch so mothers \\ncould forage for food and dig shallow, camouflaged shelters. \\nStill, these adaptations did not prepare the western barred bandicoot for the colonial-era \\ntransformation of its ecosystem, particularly the onslaught of imported British animals, from \\ncattle and rabbits that damaged delicate desert vegetation to ravenous house cats that soon \\ndeveloped a taste for bandicoots. Several of the dozen-odd bandicoot species went extinct, and \\nby the 1940s the western barred bandicoot, whose original range stretched across much of the \\ncontinent, persisted only on two predator-free islands in Shark Bay, off Australia\\'s western \\ncoast. \\n\"Our isolated fauna had simply not been exposed to these predators,\" says Reece Pedler, an \\necologist with the Wild Deserts conservation program. \\nNow Wild Deserts is using descendants of those few thousand island survivors, called Shark Bay \\nbandicoots, in a new effort to seed a mainland bandicoot revival. They\\'ve imported 20 \\nbandicoots to a preserve on the edge of the Strzelecki Desert, in the remote interior of New \\nSouth Wales. This sanctuary is a challenging place, desolate much of the year, with one of the \\nworld\\'s most mercurial rainfall patterns-relentless droughts followed by sudden drenching \\nfloods. \\nThe imported bandicoots occupy two fenced \"exclosures,\" cleared of invasive rabbits (courtesy \\nof Pedler\\'s sheepdog) and of feral cats (which slunk off once the rabbits disappeared). A third \\nfenced area contains the program\\'s Wild Training Zone, where two other rare marsupials \\n(bilbies, a larger type of bandicoot, and mulgaras, a somewhat fearsome fuzzball known for \\nsucking the brains out of prey) currently share terrain with controlled numbers of cats, learning \\nto evade them. It\\'s unclear whether the Shark Bay bandicoots, which are perhaps even more \\npredator-naive than their now-extinct mainland bandicoot kin, will be able to make that kind of \\nbreakthrough.',\n",
       "  'Online CAT Courses: https:///online.bodheeprep.com/learn \\n \\nFor now, though, a recent surge of rainfall has led to a bandicoot joey boom, raising the Wild \\nDeserts population to about 100, with other sanctuaries adding to that number. There are also \\nsigns of rebirth in the landscape itself. With their constant digging, the bandicoots trap \\nmoisture and allow for seed germination so the cattle-damaged desert can restore itself. \\nThey have a new nickname-a flattering one, this time. \"We call them ecosystem engineers,\" \\nPedler says. \\nQ. 1)  \\nWhich one of the following statements provides a gist of this passage? \\na) The onslaught of animals, such as cattle, rabbits and housecats, brought in by the British led \\nto the extinction of the western barred bandicoot. \\nb) Marsupials are going extinct due to the colonial era transformation of the ecosystem which \\nalso destroyed natural vegetation. \\nc) A type of bandicoots was nearly wiped out by invasive species but rescuers now pin hopes \\non a remnant island population. \\nd) The negligent attitude of the British colonists towards these bandicoots evidenced by the \\nnames given to them led to their annihilation. \\nQ.2) \\nThe text uses the word \\'exclosures\\' because Wild Deserts has adopted a measure of \\na) restoring cattle damaged deserts to green landscapes. \\nb) excluding animals to make the islands predator-free. \\nc) barring the entry of invasive species. \\nd) ridding the main desert of feral cats and large bilbies. \\nQ.3) \\nWhich one of the following options does NOT represent the characteristics of the western \\nbarred bandicoot? \\na) Shallow diggers having an elongated muzzle \\nb) Smallest black striped marsupial that uses camouflage and dig \\nc) Long thin nose, black striped back, pouch for joeys \\nd) Look of a rat but with a baby pouch and a slender snout \\nQ.4) \\nAccording to the text, the western barred bandicoots now have a flattering name because they \\nhave \\na) aided in altering an arid environment. \\nb) grown fivefold in terms of population. \\nc) led to a surge and increase of rainfall. \\nd) led a revival in preserving the species.',\n",

Gary Becker, for instance, pioneered the idea of human \\ncapital. To do so, he famously tackled topics like crime and domesticity, applying methods \\nhoned in the study of markets to domains of nonmarket life. He projected economics outward \\ninto new realms: for example, by revealing the extent to which humans calculate marginal \\nutilities when choosing their spouses or stealing from neighbors. At the same time, he did not \\nlet other ways of thinking enter his own economic realm: for example, he did not borrow from \\nanthropology or history or let observations of nonmarket economics inform his homo \\neconomicus. Becker was a picture of the imperial economist in the heyday of the discipline's \\nbravura. \\nTimes have changed for the once almighty discipline. Economics has been taken to task, within \\nand beyond its ramparts. Some economists have reached out, imported, borrowed, and \\ncollaborated—been less imperial, more open. Consider Thomas Piketty and his outreach to \\nhistorians. The booming field of behavioral economics-the fusion of economics and social \\npsychology-is another case. Having spawned active subfields, like judgment, decisionmaking\",\n",
       "  'Online CAT Courses: https:///online.bodheeprep.com/learn \\n \\nand a turn to experimentation, the field aims to go beyond the caricature of Rational Man to \\nexplain how humans make decisions.... \\nIt is important to underscore how this flips the way we think about economics. For generations, \\neconomists have presumed that people have interests-\"preferences,\" in the neoclassical argot-\\nthat get revealed in the course of peoples\\' choices. Interests come before actions and \\ndetermine them. If you are hungry, you buy lunch; if you are cold, you get a sweater. If you only \\nhave so much money and can\\'t afford to deal with both your growling stomach and your \\nshivering, which need you choose to meet using your scarce savings reveals your preference. \\nPsychologists take one look at this simple formulation and shake their heads. Increasingly, even \\nsome mainstream economists have to admit that homo economicus doesn\\'t always behave like \\nthe textbook maximizer; irrational behavior can\\'t simply be waved away as extraeconomic \\nexpressions of passions over interests, and thus the domain of other disciplines.... This is one \\nplace where the humanist can help the economist. If narrative economics is going to help us \\nunderstand how rivals duke it out, who wins and who loses, we are going to need much more \\nthan lessons from epidemiological studies of viruses or intracranial stimuli. \\nAbove all, we need politics and institutions. Shiller [the Nobel prize winning economist] \\nconnects perceptions of narratives to changes in behavior and thence to social outcomes. He \\ncompletes a circle that was key to behavioral economics and brings in storytelling to make \\nsense of how perceptions get framed. This cycle (perception to behavior to society) was once \\nmediated or dominated by institutions: the political parties, lobby groups, and media \\norganizations that played a vital role in legitimating, representing, and excluding interests. Yet \\ninstitutions have been stripped from Shiller\\'s account, to reveal a bare dynamic of emotions \\nand economics, without the intermediating place of politics. \\nQ.6) \\nThe author critiques Schiller\\'s approach to behavioural economics for \\na) denigrating the role of institutions while creating a link between behavioural economics and \\nperceptions. \\nb) linking emotions and rational behaviour without considering the mediation of social \\ninstitutions. \\nc) ignoring the marginal role that media and politics play in influencing people\\'s behaviour. \\nd) relying excessively on storytelling as the main influence on the formation of perceptions. \\n \\nQ. 7)  \\n\"Times have changed for the once almighty discipline.\" We can infer from this statement and \\nthe associated paragraph that the author is being \\na) disparaging of economists\\' inability to precisely predict market behaviour, and are now \\nborrowing from other disciplines to remedy this.',\n",

Simple visual signs \\nappear to have achieved a \\'near-universality\\' in this sense: though evidence remains that even \\napparently \\'natural\\' visual codes are culture specific.

The operation \\nof naturalized codes reveals not the transparency and \\'naturalness\\' of language but the depth, \\nthe habituation and the near-universality of the codes in use.

Crafts require distinct skills, an \\nallround approach to work that involves the whole product, rather than individual parts, and an \\nattitude that necessitates devotion to the job and a focus on the communal interest. The \\nconcept of craft emphasises the human touch and individual judgment.',\n",
       "  'Online CAT Courses: https:///online.bodheeprep.com/learn \\n \\nEssentially, the crafts concept seems to run against the preponderant ethos of management \\nstudies which, as the academics note, have long prioritised efficiency and consistency. . . . Craft \\nskills were portrayed as being primitive and traditionalist. \\nThe contrast between artisanship and efficiency first came to the fore in the 19th  century when \\nBritish manufacturers suddenly faced competition from across the Atlantic as firms developed \\nthe \"American system\" using standardised parts. . . the worldwide success of the Singer sewing \\nmachine showed the potential of a mass-produced device. This process created its own \\nreaction, first in the form of the Arts and Crafts movement of the late 19 th century, and then \\nagain in the \"small is beautiful\" movement of the 1970s. A third crafts movement is emerging as \\npeople become aware of the environmental impact of conventional industry. \\nThere are two potential markets for those who practise crafts. The first stems from the \\nexistence of consumers who are willing to pay a premium price for goods that are deemed to \\nbe of extra quality. . . . The second market lies in those consumers who wish to use their \\npurchases to support local workers, or to reduce their environmental impact by taking goods to \\ncraftspeople to be mended, or recycled. \\nFor workers, the appeal of craftsmanship is that it allows them the autonomy to make creative \\nchoices, and thus makes a job far more satisfying. In that sense, it could offer hope for the \\noverall labour market. Let the machines automate dull and repetitive tasks and let workers \\nfocus purely on their skills, judgment and imagination. As a current example, the academics cite \\nthe \"agile\" manifesto in the software sector, an industry at the heart of technological change. \\nThe pioneers behind the original agile manifesto promised to prioritise \"individuals and \\ninteractions over processes and tools\". By bringing together experts from different teams, agile \\nworking is designed to improve creativity. \\nBut the broader question is whether crafts can create a lot more jobs than they do today. \\nDemand for crafted products may rise but will it be easy to retrain workers in sectors that might \\nget automated (such as truck drivers) to take advantage? In a world where products and \\nservices often have to pass through regulatory hoops, large companies will usually have the \\nadvantage. \\nHistory also suggests that the link between crafts and creativity is not automatic. Medieval craft \\nguilds were monopolies which resisted new entrants. They were also highly hierarchical with \\nyoung men required to spend long periods as apprentices and journeymen before they could \\nset up on their own; by that time the innovative spirit may have been knocked out of them. \\nCraft workers can thrive in the modern era, but only if they don\\'t get too organised. \\nQ. 18) \\nWe can infer from the passage that medieval crafts guilds resembled mass production in that \\nboth',\n",

Based on the passage, choose the best \\nanswer for each question. \\nLanding in Australia, the British colonists weren\\'t much impressed with the small-bodied, \\nslender-snooted marsupials called bandicoots. \"Their muzzle, which is much too long, gives \\nthem an air exceedingly stupid,\" one naturalist noted in 1805. They nicknamed one type the \\n\"zebra rat\" because of its black-striped rump. \\nSilly-looking or not, though, the zebra rat-the smallest bandicoot, more commonly known today \\nas the western barred bandicoot-exhibited a genius for survival in the harsh outback, where its \\nancestors had persisted for some 26 million years. Its births were triggered by rainfall in the \\nbone-dry desert. It carried its breath-mint-size babies in a backward-facing pouch so mothers \\ncould forage for food and dig shallow, camouflaged shelters. \\nStill, these adaptations did not prepare the western barred bandicoot for the colonial-era \\ntransformation of its ecosystem, particularly the onslaught of imported British animals, from \\ncattle and rabbits that damaged delicate desert vegetation to ravenous house cats that soon \\ndeveloped a taste for bandicoots. Several of the dozen-odd bandicoot species went extinct, and \\nby the 1940s the western barred bandicoot, whose original range stretched across much of the \\ncontinent, persisted only on two predator-free islands in Shark Bay, off Australia\\'s western \\ncoast. \\n\"Our isolated fauna had simply not been exposed to these predators,\" says Reece Pedler, an \\necologist with the Wild Deserts conservation program. \\nNow Wild Deserts is using descendants of those few thousand island survivors, called Shark Bay \\nbandicoots, in a new effort to seed a mainland bandicoot revival. They\\'ve imported 20 \\nbandicoots to a preserve on the edge of the Strzelecki Desert, in the remote interior of New \\nSouth Wales. This sanctuary is a challenging place, desolate much of the year, with one of the \\nworld\\'s most mercurial rainfall patterns-relentless droughts followed by sudden drenching \\nfloods. \\nThe imported bandicoots occupy two fenced \"exclosures,\" cleared of invasive rabbits (courtesy \\nof Pedler\\'s sheepdog) and of feral cats (which slunk off once the rabbits disappeared). A third \\nfenced area contains the program\\'s Wild Training Zone, where two other rare marsupials \\n(bilbies, a larger type of bandicoot, and mulgaras, a somewhat fearsome fuzzball known for \\nsucking the brains out of prey) currently share terrain with controlled numbers of cats, learning \\nto evade them. It\\'s unclear whether the Shark Bay bandicoots, which are perhaps even more \\npredator-naive than their now-extinct mainland bandicoot kin, will be able to make that kind of \\nbreakthrough.',\n",
       "  'Online CAT Courses: https:///online.bodheeprep.com/learn \\n \\nFor now, though, a recent surge of rainfall has led to a bandicoot joey boom, raising the Wild \\nDeserts population to about 100, with other sanctuaries adding to that number. There are also \\nsigns of rebirth in the landscape itself. With their constant digging, the bandicoots trap \\nmoisture and allow for seed germination so the cattle-damaged desert can restore itself. \\nThey have a new nickname-a flattering one, this time. \"We call them ecosystem engineers,\" \\nPedler says. \\nQ. 1)  \\nWhich one of the following statements provides a gist of this passage? \\na) The onslaught of animals, such as cattle, rabbits and housecats, brought in by the British led \\nto the extinction of the western barred bandicoot. \\nb) Marsupials are going extinct due to the colonial era transformation of the ecosystem which \\nalso destroyed natural vegetation. \\nc) A type of bandicoots was nearly wiped out by invasive species but rescuers now pin hopes \\non a remnant island population. \\nd) The negligent attitude of the British colonists towards these bandicoots evidenced by the \\nnames given to them led to their annihilation. \\nQ.2) \\nThe text uses the word \\'exclosures\\' because Wild Deserts has adopted a measure of \\na) restoring cattle damaged deserts to green landscapes. \\nb) excluding animals to make the islands predator-free. \\nc) barring the entry of invasive species. \\nd) ridding the main desert of feral cats and large bilbies. \\nQ.3) \\nWhich one of the following options does NOT represent the characteristics of the western \\nbarred bandicoot? \\na) Shallow diggers having an elongated muzzle \\nb) Smallest black striped marsupial that uses camouflage and dig \\nc) Long thin nose, black striped back, pouch for joeys \\nd) Look of a rat but with a baby pouch and a slender snout \\nQ.4) \\nAccording to the text, the western barred bandicoots now have a flattering name because they \\nhave \\na) aided in altering an arid environment. \\nb) grown fivefold in terms of population. \\nc) led to a surge and increase of rainfall. \\nd) led a revival in preserving the species.',\n",

Based on the passage, choose the best \\nanswer for each question. \\nOftentimes, when economists cross borders, they are less interested in learning from others \\nthan in invading their garden plots. Gary Becker, for instance, pioneered the idea of human \\ncapital. To do so, he famously tackled topics like crime and domesticity, applying methods \\nhoned in the study of markets to domains of nonmarket life. He projected economics outward \\ninto new realms: for example, by revealing the extent to which humans calculate marginal \\nutilities when choosing their spouses or stealing from neighbors. At the same time, he did not \\nlet other ways of thinking enter his own economic realm: for example, he did not borrow from \\nanthropology or history or let observations of nonmarket economics inform his homo \\neconomicus. Becker was a picture of the imperial economist in the heyday of the discipline's \\nbravura. \\nTimes have changed for the once almighty discipline. Economics has been taken to task, within \\nand beyond its ramparts. Some economists have reached out, imported, borrowed, and \\ncollaborated—been less imperial, more open. Consider Thomas Piketty and his outreach to \\nhistorians. The booming field of behavioral economics-the fusion of economics and social \\npsychology-is another case. Having spawned active subfields, like judgment, decisionmaking\",\n",
       "  'Online CAT Courses: https:///online.bodheeprep.com/learn \\n \\nand a turn to experimentation, the field aims to go beyond the caricature of Rational Man to \\nexplain how humans make decisions.... \\nIt is important to underscore how this flips the way we think about economics. For generations, \\neconomists have presumed that people have interests-\"preferences,\" in the neoclassical argot-\\nthat get revealed in the course of peoples\\' choices. Interests come before actions and \\ndetermine them. If you are hungry, you buy lunch; if you are cold, you get a sweater. If you only \\nhave so much money and can\\'t afford to deal with both your growling stomach and your \\nshivering, which need you choose to meet using your scarce savings reveals your preference. \\nPsychologists take one look at this simple formulation and shake their heads. Increasingly, even \\nsome mainstream economists have to admit that homo economicus doesn\\'t always behave like \\nthe textbook maximizer; irrational behavior can\\'t simply be waved away as extraeconomic \\nexpressions of passions over interests, and thus the domain of other disciplines.... This is one \\nplace where the humanist can help the economist. If narrative economics is going to help us \\nunderstand how rivals duke it out, who wins and who loses, we are going to need much more \\nthan lessons from epidemiological studies of viruses or intracranial stimuli. \\nAbove all, we need politics and institutions. Shiller [the Nobel prize winning economist] \\nconnects perceptions of narratives to changes in behavior and thence to social outcomes. He \\ncompletes a circle that was key to behavioral economics and brings in storytelling to make \\nsense of how perceptions get framed. This cycle (perception to behavior to society) was once \\nmediated or dominated by institutions: the political parties, lobby groups, and media \\norganizations that played a vital role in legitimating, representing, and excluding interests. Yet \\ninstitutions have been stripped from Shiller\\'s account, to reveal a bare dynamic of emotions \\nand economics, without the intermediating place of politics. \\nQ.6) \\nThe author critiques Schiller\\'s approach to behavioural economics for \\na) denigrating the role of institutions while creating a link between behavioural economics and \\nperceptions. \\nb) linking emotions and rational behaviour without considering the mediation of social \\ninstitutions. \\nc) ignoring the marginal role that media and politics play in influencing people\\'s behaviour. \\nd) relying excessively on storytelling as the main influence on the formation of perceptions. \\n \\nQ. 7)  \\n\"Times have changed for the once almighty discipline.\" We can infer from this statement and \\nthe associated paragraph that the author is being \\na) disparaging of economists\\' inability to precisely predict market behaviour, and are now \\nborrowing from other disciplines to remedy this.',\n",

Simple visual signs \\nappear to have achieved a \\'near-universality\\' in this sense: though evidence remains that even \\napparently \\'natural\\' visual codes are culture specific. However, this does not mean that no \\ncodes have intervened; rather, that the codes have been profoundly naturalized. The operation \\nof naturalized codes reveals not the transparency and \\'naturalness\\' of language but the depth, \\nthe habituation and the near-universality of the codes in use. They produce apparently \\'natural\\' \\nrecognitions. This has the (ideological) effect of concealing the practices of coding which are \\npresent. \\na) All codes, linguistic and visual, have a natural origin but some are so widespread that they \\nbecome universal. This is what hides the mechanism of coding behind signs. \\nb) Not all codes are natural but certain codes are naturalized and made to appear universal. \\nIdeology aims to hide the mechanism of coding behind signs. \\nc) Language and visual signs are codes.

While the makers of Blu-ray discs \\nclaim they have a shelf life of 100 years, such statistics remain largely theoretical until they \\ncome to pass, and are dependent on storage conditions, not to mention the continued \\navailability of playback equipment.

After a man took to Twitter to bemoan \\nlosing access to Cars 2 after moving from Canada to Australia, Apple clarified that users who \\ndownloaded films to their devices would retain permanent access to those downloads, even if \\nthey relocated to a hemisphere where the [content was] subject to a different set of rights \\nagreements. Thanks to the company\\'s ironclad digital rights management technology, however, \\nsuch files cannot be moved or backed up, locking you into watching with your Apple account. \\nAnyone who does manage to acquire Digital Rights Management free (DRM-free) copies of \\ntheir favourite films must nonetheless grapple with ever-changing file format standards, not to \\nmention data decay - the gradual process by which electronic information slowly but surely \\ncorrupts. Only the regular migration of files from hard drive to hard drive can delay the \\ninevitable, in a sisyphean battle against the ravages of digital time. \\nIn a sense, none of this is new. Charlie Chaplin burned the negative of his 1926 film A Woman of \\nthe Sea as a tax write-off. Many more films have been lost through accident, negligence or plain \\nindifference. During a heatwave in July 1937, a Fox film vault in New Jersey burned down, \\ndestroying a majority of the silent films produced by the studio. \\nBack then, at least, cinema was defined by its ephemerality: the sense that a film was as good \\nas gone once it left your local cinema. Today, with film studios keen to stress the breadth of \\ntheir back catalogues (or to put in Hollywood terms, the value of their IPs), audiences may start \\nto wonder why those same studios seem happy to set the vault alight themselves if it\\'ll help \\nnext quarter\\'s numbers. \\nQ. 14)  \\nWhich one of the following statements, if true, would best invalidate the main argument of the \\npassage? \\na) Studios and streaming services have committed to giving customers perpetual and platform \\nindependent access to the original digital content they have paid for. \\nb) When moving to a different geographical location, customers can easily use Virtual Private \\nNetworks (VPNs) to bypass geo-blocking and regain access to their content on any \\nstreaming service. \\nc) Improved cloud storage services have made it possible for movie collections to now be \\npreserved in perpetuity, without the need to keep migrating the files. \\nd) Recent research has irrefutably proven that Blu-Ray discs have a shelf life of at least 100 \\nyears. \\nQ. 15)  \\n\"Netflix had begun editing old episodes of Stranger Things to retroactively improve their visual \\neffects.\" What is the purpose of this example used in the passage? \\na) To show that streaming services are controlling access to the cultural commons rather than \\nexpanding it.',\n",

Based on the passage, choose the best \\nanswer for each question. \\n. . . [T]he idea of craftsmanship is not simply nostalgic. . . . Crafts require distinct skills, an \\nallround approach to work that involves the whole product, rather than individual parts, and an \\nattitude that necessitates devotion to the job and a focus on the communal interest. The \\nconcept of craft emphasises the human touch and individual judgment.',\n",
       "  'Online CAT Courses: https:///online.bodheeprep.com/learn \\n \\nEssentially, the crafts concept seems to run against the preponderant ethos of management \\nstudies which, as the academics note, have long prioritised efficiency and consistency. . . . Craft \\nskills were portrayed as being primitive and traditionalist. \\nThe contrast between artisanship and efficiency first came to the fore in the 19th  century when \\nBritish manufacturers suddenly faced competition from across the Atlantic as firms developed \\nthe \"American system\" using standardised parts. . . the worldwide success of the Singer sewing \\nmachine showed the potential of a mass-produced device. This process created its own \\nreaction, first in the form of the Arts and Crafts movement of the late 19 th century, and then \\nagain in the \"small is beautiful\" movement of the 1970s. A third crafts movement is emerging as \\npeople become aware of the environmental impact of conventional industry. \\nThere are two potential markets for those who practise crafts. The first stems from the \\nexistence of consumers who are willing to pay a premium price for goods that are deemed to \\nbe of extra quality. . . . The second market lies in those consumers who wish to use their \\npurchases to support local workers, or to reduce their environmental impact by taking goods to \\ncraftspeople to be mended, or recycled. \\nFor workers, the appeal of craftsmanship is that it allows them the autonomy to make creative \\nchoices, and thus makes a job far more satisfying. In that sense, it could offer hope for the \\noverall labour market. Let the machines automate dull and repetitive tasks and let workers \\nfocus purely on their skills, judgment and imagination. As a current example, the academics cite \\nthe \"agile\" manifesto in the software sector, an industry at the heart of technological change. \\nThe pioneers behind the original agile manifesto promised to prioritise \"individuals and \\ninteractions over processes and tools\". By bringing together experts from different teams, agile \\nworking is designed to improve creativity. \\nBut the broader question is whether crafts can create a lot more jobs than they do today. \\nDemand for crafted products may rise but will it be easy to retrain workers in sectors that might \\nget automated (such as truck drivers) to take advantage? In a world where products and \\nservices often have to pass through regulatory hoops, large companies will usually have the \\nadvantage. \\nHistory also suggests that the link between crafts and creativity is not automatic. Medieval craft \\nguilds were monopolies which resisted new entrants. They were also highly hierarchical with \\nyoung men required to spend long periods as apprentices and journeymen before they could \\nset up on their own; by that time the innovative spirit may have been knocked out of them. \\nCraft workers can thrive in the modern era, but only if they don\\'t get too organised. \\nQ. 18) \\nWe can infer from the passage that medieval crafts guilds resembled mass production in that \\nboth',\n",
       "  'Online CAT Courses: https:///online.bodheeprep.com/learn \\n \\na) discouraged innovation by restricting entry through strict rules. \\nb) did not always employ egalitarian production processes. \\nc) did not necessarily promote creativity. \\nd) focused excessively on product quality. \\nQ. 19) \\nWhich one of the following statements is NOT inconsistent with the views stated in the \\npassage? \\na) We need to support the crafts; only then can we retain the creativity intrinsic to their \\nproduction. \\nb) The Arts and Crafts movement was initially inspired by the \"American system\" of \\nproduction. \\nc) Creativity in the crafts could be stifled if the market for artisan goods becomes too \\norganised. \\nd) The agile movement in software is a throwback to the tenets of the medieval crafts guilds. \\nQ. 20) \\nThe author questions the ability of crafts to create substantial employment opportunities \\npresently because \\na) the low scale of crafts production will not be able to absorb the mass of redundant labour. \\nb) regulatory requirements could make it difficult for small crafts outfits to compete. \\nc) workers made redundant by automation are unlikely to opt for crafts-related work. \\nd) crafts guilds tend to resist new entrants and are unlikely to accept large numbers of \\ntrainees. \\nQ. 21) \\nThe most recent revival in interest in the crafts is a result of the emergence of all of the \\nfollowing EXCEPT: \\na) concerns about the environmental impact of mass production. \\nb) a niche market for discerning buyers of quality products. \\nc) support for individual creations as opposed to mass-produced objects. \\nd) a greater interest in buying locally produced goods. \\nQ. 22) \\nThere is a sentence that is missing in the paragraph below.

Based on the passage, choose the best \\nanswer for each question. \\nLanding in Australia, the British colonists weren\\'t much impressed with the small-bodied, \\nslender-snooted marsupials called bandicoots. \"Their muzzle, which is much too long, gives \\nthem an air exceedingly stupid,\" one naturalist noted in 1805. They nicknamed one type the \\n\"zebra rat\" because of its black-striped rump. \\nSilly-looking or not, though, the zebra rat-the smallest bandicoot, more commonly known today \\nas the western barred bandicoot-exhibited a genius for survival in the harsh outback, where its \\nancestors had persisted for some 26 million years. Its births were triggered by rainfall in the \\nbone-dry desert. It carried its breath-mint-size babies in a backward-facing pouch so mothers \\ncould forage for food and dig shallow, camouflaged shelters. \\nStill, these adaptations did not prepare the western barred bandicoot for the colonial-era \\ntransformation of its ecosystem, particularly the onslaught of imported British animals, from \\ncattle and rabbits that damaged delicate desert vegetation to ravenous house cats that soon \\ndeveloped a taste for bandicoots. Several of the dozen-odd bandicoot species went extinct, and \\nby the 1940s the western barred bandicoot, whose original range stretched across much of the \\ncontinent, persisted only on two predator-free islands in Shark Bay, off Australia\\'s western \\ncoast. \\n\"Our isolated fauna had simply not been exposed to these predators,\" says Reece Pedler, an \\necologist with the Wild Deserts conservation program. \\nNow Wild Deserts is using descendants of those few thousand island survivors, called Shark Bay \\nbandicoots, in a new effort to seed a mainland bandicoot revival. They\\'ve imported 20 \\nbandicoots to a preserve on the edge of the Strzelecki Desert, in the remote interior of New \\nSouth Wales. This sanctuary is a challenging place, desolate much of the year, with one of the \\nworld\\'s most mercurial rainfall patterns-relentless droughts followed by sudden drenching \\nfloods. \\nThe imported bandicoots occupy two fenced \"exclosures,\" cleared of invasive rabbits (courtesy \\nof Pedler\\'s sheepdog) and of feral cats (which slunk off once the rabbits disappeared). A third \\nfenced area contains the program\\'s Wild Training Zone, where two other rare marsupials \\n(bilbies, a larger type of bandicoot, and mulgaras, a somewhat fearsome fuzzball known for \\nsucking the brains out of prey) currently share terrain with controlled numbers of cats, learning \\nto evade them. It\\'s unclear whether the Shark Bay bandicoots, which are perhaps even more \\npredator-naive than their now-extinct mainland bandicoot kin, will be able to make that kind of \\nbreakthrough.',\n",
       "  'Online CAT Courses: https:///online.bodheeprep.com/learn \\n \\nFor now, though, a recent surge of rainfall has led to a bandicoot joey boom, raising the Wild \\nDeserts population to about 100, with other sanctuaries adding to that number. There are also \\nsigns of rebirth in the landscape itself. With their constant digging, the bandicoots trap \\nmoisture and allow for seed germination so the cattle-damaged desert can restore itself. \\nThey have a new nickname-a flattering one, this time. \"We call them ecosystem engineers,\" \\nPedler says. \\nQ. 1)  \\nWhich one of the following statements provides a gist of this passage? \\na) The onslaught of animals, such as cattle, rabbits and housecats, brought in by the British led \\nto the extinction of the western barred bandicoot. \\nb) Marsupials are going extinct due to the colonial era transformation of the ecosystem which \\nalso destroyed natural vegetation. \\nc) A type of bandicoots was nearly wiped out by invasive species but rescuers now pin hopes \\non a remnant island population. \\nd) The negligent attitude of the British colonists towards these bandicoots evidenced by the \\nnames given to them led to their annihilation. \\nQ.2) \\nThe text uses the word \\'exclosures\\' because Wild Deserts has adopted a measure of \\na) restoring cattle damaged deserts to green landscapes. \\nb) excluding animals to make the islands predator-free. \\nc) barring the entry of invasive species. \\nd) ridding the main desert of feral cats and large bilbies. \\nQ.3) \\nWhich one of the following options does NOT represent the characteristics of the western \\nbarred bandicoot? \\na) Shallow diggers having an elongated muzzle \\nb) Smallest black striped marsupial that uses camouflage and dig \\nc) Long thin nose, black striped back, pouch for joeys \\nd) Look of a rat but with a baby pouch and a slender snout \\nQ.4) \\nAccording to the text, the western barred bandicoots now have a flattering name because they \\nhave \\na) aided in altering an arid environment. \\nb) grown fivefold in terms of population. \\nc) led to a surge and increase of rainfall. \\nd) led a revival in preserving the species.',\n",

Based on the passage, choose the best \\nanswer for each question. \\nOftentimes, when economists cross borders, they are less interested in learning from others \\nthan in invading their garden plots. Gary Becker, for instance, pioneered the idea of human \\ncapital. To do so, he famously tackled topics like crime and domesticity, applying methods \\nhoned in the study of markets to domains of nonmarket life. He projected economics outward \\ninto new realms: for example, by revealing the extent to which humans calculate marginal \\nutilities when choosing their spouses or stealing from neighbors. At the same time, he did not \\nlet other ways of thinking enter his own economic realm: for example, he did not borrow from \\nanthropology or history or let observations of nonmarket economics inform his homo \\neconomicus. Becker was a picture of the imperial economist in the heyday of the discipline's \\nbravura. \\nTimes have changed for the once almighty discipline. Economics has been taken to task, within \\nand beyond its ramparts. Some economists have reached out, imported, borrowed, and \\ncollaborated—been less imperial, more open. Consider Thomas Piketty and his outreach to \\nhistorians. The booming field of behavioral economics-the fusion of economics and social \\npsychology-is another case. Having spawned active subfields, like judgment, decisionmaking\",\n",
       "  'Online CAT Courses: https:///online.bodheeprep.com/learn \\n \\nand a turn to experimentation, the field aims to go beyond the caricature of Rational Man to \\nexplain how humans make decisions.... \\nIt is important to underscore how this flips the way we think about economics. For generations, \\neconomists have presumed that people have interests-\"preferences,\" in the neoclassical argot-\\nthat get revealed in the course of peoples\\' choices. Interests come before actions and \\ndetermine them. If you are hungry, you buy lunch; if you are cold, you get a sweater. If you only \\nhave so much money and can\\'t afford to deal with both your growling stomach and your \\nshivering, which need you choose to meet using your scarce savings reveals your preference. \\nPsychologists take one look at this simple formulation and shake their heads. Increasingly, even \\nsome mainstream economists have to admit that homo economicus doesn\\'t always behave like \\nthe textbook maximizer; irrational behavior can\\'t simply be waved away as extraeconomic \\nexpressions of passions over interests, and thus the domain of other disciplines.... This is one \\nplace where the humanist can help the economist. If narrative economics is going to help us \\nunderstand how rivals duke it out, who wins and who loses, we are going to need much more \\nthan lessons from epidemiological studies of viruses or intracranial stimuli. \\nAbove all, we need politics and institutions. Shiller [the Nobel prize winning economist] \\nconnects perceptions of narratives to changes in behavior and thence to social outcomes. He \\ncompletes a circle that was key to behavioral economics and brings in storytelling to make \\nsense of how perceptions get framed. This cycle (perception to behavior to society) was once \\nmediated or dominated by institutions: the political parties, lobby groups, and media \\norganizations that played a vital role in legitimating, representing, and excluding interests. Yet \\ninstitutions have been stripped from Shiller\\'s account, to reveal a bare dynamic of emotions \\nand economics, without the intermediating place of politics. \\nQ.6) \\nThe author critiques Schiller\\'s approach to behavioural economics for \\na) denigrating the role of institutions while creating a link between behavioural economics and \\nperceptions. \\nb) linking emotions and rational behaviour without considering the mediation of social \\ninstitutions. \\nc) ignoring the marginal role that media and politics play in influencing people\\'s behaviour. \\nd) relying excessively on storytelling as the main influence on the formation of perceptions. \\n \\nQ. 7)  \\n\"Times have changed for the once almighty discipline.\" We can infer from this statement and \\nthe associated paragraph that the author is being \\na) disparaging of economists\\' inability to precisely predict market behaviour, and are now \\nborrowing from other disciplines to remedy this.',\n",

Simple visual signs \\nappear to have achieved a \\'near-universality\\' in this sense: though evidence remains that even \\napparently \\'natural\\' visual codes are culture specific. However, this does not mean that no \\ncodes have intervened; rather, that the codes have been profoundly naturalized. The operation \\nof naturalized codes reveals not the transparency and \\'naturalness\\' of language but the depth, \\nthe habituation and the near-universality of the codes in use.

While the makers of Blu-ray discs \\nclaim they have a shelf life of 100 years, such statistics remain largely theoretical until they \\ncome to pass, and are dependent on storage conditions, not to mention the continued \\navailability of playback equipment.

Crafts require distinct skills, an \\nallround approach to work that involves the whole product, rather than individual parts, and an \\nattitude that necessitates devotion to the job and a focus on the communal interest. The \\nconcept of craft emphasises the human touch and individual judgment.',\n",
       "  'Online CAT Courses: https:///online.bodheeprep.com/learn \\n \\nEssentially, the crafts concept seems to run against the preponderant ethos of management \\nstudies which, as the academics note, have long prioritised efficiency and consistency. . . . Craft \\nskills were portrayed as being primitive and traditionalist. \\nThe contrast between artisanship and efficiency first came to the fore in the 19th  century when \\nBritish manufacturers suddenly faced competition from across the Atlantic as firms developed \\nthe \"American system\" using standardised parts. . . the worldwide success of the Singer sewing \\nmachine showed the potential of a mass-produced device. This process created its own \\nreaction, first in the form of the Arts and Crafts movement of the late 19 th century, and then \\nagain in the \"small is beautiful\" movement of the 1970s. A third crafts movement is emerging as \\npeople become aware of the environmental impact of conventional industry. \\nThere are two potential markets for those who practise crafts. The first stems from the \\nexistence of consumers who are willing to pay a premium price for goods that are deemed to \\nbe of extra quality. . . . The second market lies in those consumers who wish to use their \\npurchases to support local workers, or to reduce their environmental impact by taking goods to \\ncraftspeople to be mended, or recycled. \\nFor workers, the appeal of craftsmanship is that it allows them the autonomy to make creative \\nchoices, and thus makes a job far more satisfying. In that sense, it could offer hope for the \\noverall labour market. Let the machines automate dull and repetitive tasks and let workers \\nfocus purely on their skills, judgment and imagination. As a current example, the academics cite \\nthe \"agile\" manifesto in the software sector, an industry at the heart of technological change. \\nThe pioneers behind the original agile manifesto promised to prioritise \"individuals and \\ninteractions over processes and tools\". By bringing together experts from different teams, agile \\nworking is designed to improve creativity. \\nBut the broader question is whether crafts can create a lot more jobs than they do today. \\nDemand for crafted products may rise but will it be easy to retrain workers in sectors that might \\nget automated (such as truck drivers) to take advantage? In a world where products and \\nservices often have to pass through regulatory hoops, large companies will usually have the \\nadvantage. \\nHistory also suggests that the link between crafts and creativity is not automatic. Medieval craft \\nguilds were monopolies which resisted new entrants.

This has \\nchanged now, however, due to all kinds of societal and technological developments. Today, \\nmap readers are more demanding-mostly because of the tools they use to read maps. \\nCartographers, who are also influenced by these trends, are now more interested in seeing if \\ntheir products are efficient, effective, and appreciated. \\na) New technological developments have prompted cartographers to experiment with their \\nmaps by applying these new innovations. \\nb) Today, cartographers also need to look into the usability of maps because of the new \\ntechnological developments. \\nc) Maps are being used for a variety of reasons and therefore map readers have become more \\ndemanding. \\nd) Modern mapmakers evaluate a map\\'s effectiveness efficiency and satisfaction of the user \\nthrough a series of experiments. \\nQ. 24) \\nFive jumbled up sentences (labelled 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5), related to a topic, are given below.
